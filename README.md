## Features
1. Who's That Pokemon type gameplay (can't see or hear Pokemon in battle).
2. Darkness mode (makes the whole game as if you were in a cave which you can turn on/off at beginning of game).

## QOL Updates:
1. Once you get an HM, you don't have to teach it to a Pokemon. You can just interact with said thing and it will trigger the HM.
2. Streamer Mode (Provides rare candies to hurry up the grind process).
3. Running shoes from the start

## Known Issues:
1. Depending on the emulator you use, it's possible for the game to freeze but is rare. Save often so you don't lose anything!
2. If darkness mode is on then you will still see what Pokemon is inside the ball when choosing your starter. Currently no workaround for it.
